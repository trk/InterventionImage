# Intervention Image Module for ProcessWire CMS/CMF

This module provides a high-performance responsive image engine using Intervention Image v3.

Supports delayed rendering, auto-detection of drivers, and modern formats like WebP/AVIF.

This module overwrites the default image engine in ProcessWire.

You can use same methods with ProcessWire's default image engine.

I will revisit this file, in development stage.
